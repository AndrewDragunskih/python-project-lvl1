Project version: 0.1.0

Authors: Andrew Dragunskih <andrew.dragunskih@yandex.ru>

The project includes a set of games listed below:
Game: "Even"
The essence of the game is as follows: You are shown a random number. You must answer 'yes' if the number is even, or 'no' if it is odd.
Game: "Calculator"
The essence of the game is as follows: You are shown a random mathematical expression, for example 35 + 16, which you need to calculate and write down the correct answer.
Game "GCD"
The essence of the game is as follows: You are shown two random numbers, for example, 25 50. You need to calculate and enter the greatest common divisor of these numbers.
Game "Arithmetic progression"
The essence of the game is as follows: You are shown a series of numbers that form an arithmetic progression. One of the numbers is replaced by two dots. You need to determine this number.
Game "Is it a prime number?"
The essence of the game is as follows: You are shown a random number. You must answer 'yes' if the number is prime, or 'no' if not.
